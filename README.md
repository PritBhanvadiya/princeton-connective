# Princeton Connective

Hi there

This project is built using **Next.js (JavaScript)** and **TailwindCSS**.  
I’ve also used **GSAP**, **Framer Motion**, and **Swiper** for animations and sliders.

## Pages Included
- Home page  
- About page  
- Blog page  
- Blog detail page  
- Contact page  

The header has a “Company” dropdown — all the grouped pages under it are completed.

## Why I Added a Blog Section
I wanted to show my skills in **dynamic routing** and how I handle **layout optimization** in Next.js.

---

## About the Icons
Some icons are slightly different from the original design because those were part of a builder package.  
I replaced most of them manually and used downloaded ones where possible.

---

## Responsive Layout
The original design wasn’t very responsive, so I created my own responsive layout using TailwindCSS.

---

## Summary
This project helped me practice:
- Working with Next.js structure  
- Using GSAP and Framer Motion for animations  
- Creating custom layouts and responsive pages
