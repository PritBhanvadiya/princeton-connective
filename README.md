# Princeton Connective

A modern showcase website built with **React**, **Next.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
Originally created as part of a technical interview task, this project has been refined and expanded to highlight my front-end development skills, component design, and responsive layout techniques.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **React.js** – Component-based UI architecture  
- **Next.js** – Framework for server-side rendering and routing  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling for rapid, responsive design  

---

## 🌟 Features

- Clean, modern showcase design  
- Fully responsive layout (mobile-first)  
- Smooth transitions and animations  
- Modular, reusable components  
- SEO-friendly structure with Next.js  

---

## 🧩 Project Purpose

This project serves as a **portfolio piece** to demonstrate front-end architecture, attention to UI/UX detail, and modern development practices.

Would you like me to make it sound a bit **more portfolio-polished** (less like documentation, more storytelling-style for recruiters)?  
That version would read more like a personal project highlight for your GitHub profile or website.
